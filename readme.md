# Grid Selection

This is an implementation of a grid system as used in games such as Advance wars, Into the breach, Baba is you, The banner saga, Fire emblem etc.

This is to showcase on how such a grid system may be implemented using my custom engine Project-TE.

This grid will currently only be a straight-on grid. As in birds eye view grid, or where the axis of the grids align with the window's axis.  
It will not be any 2.5d like The banner saga style view for the game, not will it have functionality to change the rotation or elavation of viewing the grid.  
Since being able to have different viewing angles for the grid is also desirable, it may be implemented at a later time.
